# Virtual Riller Network (VRN) – Complete Ghost Mode

One-command install → fully invisible proxy server.  
Tested and working on Fedora 41, Debian 12, Ubuntu 24.04.

## Goal
Your real IP, MAC, and traffic pattern become untraceable.  
DPI, ISP logging, Great Firewall, corporate filters — everything sees normal Microsoft CDN traffic.

## One-Command Install (run as root on a fresh VPS)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourname/VRN/main/install.sh | bash
